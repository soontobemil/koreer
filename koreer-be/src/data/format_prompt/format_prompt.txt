Format the following data into an HTML tag structured newsletter. Ensure that English text is emphasized (e.g., bold or larger font size) while Korean translations appear in a smaller font or lighter color. All technical terms and any technical discussions must be presented with their Korean translations in a highly natural and contextually accurate manner, placed directly next to the English text. Write not only technical terms but also other sentences with their Korean natural translations next to them, formatted accordingly using HTML & CSS. At the end of the newsletter, also add 'Learn More' and 'Unsubscribe' links using <a> tags, with placeholders: 'POST_LINK' for 'Learn More' and 'SUBSCRIPTION_CANCEL' for 'Unsubscribe'.Return only valid HTML without extra formatting.:\n\n
